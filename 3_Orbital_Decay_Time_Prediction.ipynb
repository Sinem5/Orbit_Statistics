    "> To ensure both statistical relevance and predictive performance in modeling orbital decay time, I performed feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a CatBoost regressor, a gradient boosting model known for handling non-linear relationships and categorical features effectively. While any machine learning model could be employed for feature selection, CatBoost was chosen for its robustness and interpretability in tabular data. The model identified five optimal features which consistently yielded the lowest mean squared error across cross-validation folds. Notably, all selected features also demonstrated high mutual information with the target variable, confirming their strong statistical dependency and physical relevance in the orbital decay process. Therefore, moving forward, these five features will be used as the core input set for model development and evaluation.\n",

    "> The model demonstrates a reasonable fit on the training set with an R² of 0.7420, indicating that it can explain approximately 74.2% of the variance in the target variable, accompanied by a relatively low RMSE and MAE. However, performance significantly drops on the validation and test sets, with R² scores of 0.5155 and 0.1896, respectively. This decline suggests that the model may be overfitting the training data and struggling to generalize to unseen samples, particularly under time-based validation, where temporal distribution shifts can challenge model robustness. The large increase in RMSE and MAE on the validation and test sets further supports this, highlighting the need for improved generalization, possibly through regularization or re-examination of temporal patterns in the dataset."
